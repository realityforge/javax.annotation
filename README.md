The `javax.annotation` package is a mess with various historic and active JSRs and various libraries defining
members in this package. This package contains the minimal subset that are used in GWT and J2CL applications.
The purpose of this library is to make it provide a J2CL compatible library.

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.realityforge.javax.annotation</groupId>
